# Configuring SeaGOAT

## Introduction

Some features of SeaGOAT can be configured through config files.
All configuration files are written in the *YAML* format.

There are two types of configuration files:

* **Global configuration files**. Use `seagoat-server server-info` to find the
location of this file on your system.
[Learn more](server.md#retrieving-server-information).
* **Project configuration files**. Located in a file called
`seagoat.yml` in the root folder of your repository.

Both of these types of configuration files have the exact same format, and
your project-wide configuration files are merged with the global
configuration. Whenever both your local as well as global configuration
files define a value, the local value takes precedence.

This is an example of a configuration file:

```yaml
# .seagoat.yml

server:
  port: 31134  # A port number to run the server on

  # globs to ignore in addition to .gitignore
  ignorePatterns:
    - "**/locales/*" # Ignore all files inside 'locales' directories
    - "**/*.po"     # Ignore all gettext translation files

client:
  # Connect the CLI to a remove server
  host: https://example.com/seagoat-instance/

```

## Available configuration options

### Server

Server-related configuration resides under the `server` attribute in your
config files.

The following values can be configured:

* `port`: The port number the server will run on
* `ignorePatterns`: A list of glob patterns to ignore. Keep in mind that all
files ignored by `.gitignore` are already ignored. You probably should not
need to configure this value. It is only useful if there are some files that
you wish to keep in git, but you wish to hide from SeaGOAT.

* `chroma`: Configurations for the ChromaDB based features.
  Has the following attributes:
  * `embeddingFunction`:
    * `name`: Name of the embedding function to use.
    See [ChromaDB's docs for more](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings)
    * `arguments`: Arguments to pass to the embedding function.
      * If you wanted to use the `ONNXMiniLM_L6_V2` embedding model with TensorRT

        ```yaml
        server:
        ...
        chroma:
          embedding_function:
            name: "ONNXMiniLM_L6_V2"
            arguments:
              preferred_providers: ["TensorrtExecutionProvider"]
        ```

### Client

Configuration for the CLI (`gt` command) resides under the `client` attribute.

The following values can be configured:

* `host`: The URL of the SeaGOAT instance to connect to. This is only
needed when you are hosting your SeaGOAT server on a remote computer. *It is
recommended to set this value in your project configuration file, so that
you are still able to use the local server for different projects.*
