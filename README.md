_ðŸ›Ÿ Looking for someone to help me benchmark the accuracy of SeaGOAT._
_If you can help me make it happen, [let me know](https://github.com/kantord)!_

## Getting started

### Install SeaGOAT

In order to install SeaGOAT, you need to have the following
dependencies already installed on your computer:

- Python 3.11 or newer
- ripgrep
- [https://github.com/sharkdp/bat](bat) (**optional**)

When `bat` is [installed](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#on-ubuntu-using-apt),
it is used to display results as long as color is enabled. When SeaGOAT is
used as part of a pipeline, a grep-line output format is used. When color is
enabled, but `bat` is not installed, SeaGOAT will highlight the output using
pygments. Using `bat` is recommended.

To install SeaGOAT using `pipx`, use the following command:

```bash
pipx install seagoat
```

### Start SeaGOAT server

In order to use SeaGOAT in your project, you have to start the SeaGOAT server
using the following command:

```bash
seagoat-server start /path/to/your/repo
```

### Search your repository

If you have the server running, you can simply use the
`gt` or `seagoat` command to query your repository. For example:

```bash
gt "Where are the numbers rounded"
```

You can also use
[Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
in your queries, for example

```bash
gt "function calc_.* that deals with taxes"
```

### Stopping the server

You can stop the running server using the following command:

```bash
seagoat-server stop /path/to/your/repo
```

## Development

**Requirements**:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Python 3.11 or newer
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

### Install dependencies

After cloning the repository, install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Running tests

#### Watch mode (recommended)

```bash
poetry run ptw
```

#### Test changed files

```bash
poetry run pytest .  --testmon
```

#### Test all files

```bash
poetry run pytest .
```

### Manual testing

You can test any SeaGOAT command manually in your local development
environment. For example to test the development version of the
`seagoat-server` command, you can run:

```bash
poetry run seagoat-server ~/path/an/example/repository
```
